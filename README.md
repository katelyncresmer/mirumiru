On this project we worked with C#, XNA and Kinect and even though we ran into a lot of problems, we had an enjoyable experience by learning new things and meeting new people.

If you're going to venture out and try to build a game with C# or the Kinect, we would like to offer some advice on advoiding obstacles that we came across. 

First, make sure the version of the programs you are using are the same as the tutorials you are looking up or the code found in Google's search results. We ran into code being obsolete because we were using a newer version and our tutorial was using an older version.

Second, meet a pragrammer. We were lucky enough to sit next to a programmer who gave us a copy of the XNA ebook. Or, you could just go checkout the textbook from the library. But, why not meet a new friend? I didn't know where to start with creating bubbles in C#, so I'm glad that the textbook taught me about sprites and how to draw them.

Third, read the code and make some sense out of it. Naming variables is different, loops are different and functions are different. If you put something in the wrong spot, you could mess up everything. You could go to the computer programming department and ask the instructors for advice. 

Fourth, if you are using Microsoft Visual Studios, the line numbers DO NOT show up automatically. You have to turn them on yourself. Go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > Languages and check the "Display Line Numbers" box. This helps when the console is telling you that you have an error on line 118 and you have no idea where you're at.

Last but not least, we got frustrated a lot because we didn't know what we were doing. So, just have fun. :)
